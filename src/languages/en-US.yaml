  **Messages archiving command**.

  Usage: `{prefix} [target type], <target>, <target>, <...>, <# of messages>, <offset>`.

  Available target types (target type — targets):
  • `channel` — `[#channel / Channel ID]`, `u: [@user#1234 / User ID]`
   Archives only messages from the target channels and users (if chosen).
  • `user` — `[@user#1234 / User ID]`
   Archives only users' messages from the server.
  • `guild` — *no targets*
   Archives all the messages from the server.

  Maximum number of messages to archive is {limit, plural, one {# message} other {# messages}}.
  Use `offset` argument to get next `n` number of messages.

  Messages archived only from the channels you have access to, other messages will be hidden.

  • Every time stream starts on this channel, related notifications will be sent to your Direct Messages.

  • If you block the bot, or lose any mutual servers with it, bot will automatically remove your subscription. Unfortunately, you cannot add bots as friends in Discord, so you forced to have at least one mutual server with enabled Direct Messages. [Vote for idea of adding bots as friends](https://feedback.discordapp.com/forums/326712/suggestions/33019324)!

  • Bot will attempt to check if the stream is currently online immediately, after you confirm the subscription. This may not work for some platforms.

  • Content of the embed is also depending on streaming platform.
